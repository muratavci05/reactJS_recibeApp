**It was created by dividing into components in accordance with the ReactJS component structure, and it was used to navigate the application pages easily with React-Router-Dom,

**- Search: By entering the first letter of the recipe to be searched, the dynamic structure starts to filter. Filtered results are displayed on the screen. If you wish, the desired keyword can be searched for quick results,

**- Dynamic Alphabetical Menu: Alphabetically searched (A-Z) recipes can be accessed, dynamically with a conditional if structure,

**- Dynamic pages: With the unique id structure coming from the API, a page structure has been created where detailed material information, recipe and youtube video of each recipe can be accessed,
